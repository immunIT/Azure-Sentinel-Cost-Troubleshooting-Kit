# Azure-Sentinel-Cost-Troubleshooting-Kit
<i>Guidance and collateral for troubleshooting and managing Azure Sentinel data costs.</i>

The intent of this "kit" is not a best practices doc, but instead a growing collection of resources that can help identify and managed costs associated with data ingestion and retention. Each environment is different. There may be guidance and collateral here that is useful and interesting, but not valuable to the specific environment. Take care to identify those areas that make sense to capture and collate.  

This is an evolving resource with the intent to be community sourced and developed.
